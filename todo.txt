allow custom arguments... maybe have some preprocessor logic going on at
the command line? For example if we want to define a mapping for output:

 nnoremap <leader>o PyUniteStart output:ls<CR>

But then we would have to define a new mapping for every command. Another
option is how Unite does it: it has custom code that prompts the user for
the input depending on the source. <--- Uggghhh!!
How about we get awesome and allow preprocessing directives a la shell
  
  nnoremap <leader>o PyUniteStart output:${ command? }

Then PyUnite will automatically prompt the user and the user's input will
become an argument for the source. All the other arguments will get parsed
too, so in the following case:

  nnoremap <leader>o PyUniteStart output:{%Vim Command: %}:other_opt
  >> Vim Command: ls

The args would be ['ls', 'other_opt']. Voila... flexible arguments I'm
calling it.
